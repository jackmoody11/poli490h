# POLI 490H Data Analysis
This repository aims to look at how different marijuana-related offenses are treated in courts in North Carolina.

Distinguish between possession/using, selling/delivering, and trafficking

**TODO**:
- To refine the paper, you can look at the different types of drugs/classifications
- Ask contacts what punishments are harsher than others
- Add variables: population & population/square mile

**Research Question**: How does punishment vary for drug-related crimes county-by-county in North Carolina?

**Notes**:
- Use Logistic Regression if dependent variable matches that (0 or 1)
- Use Linear Regression if dependent variable isn't bounded/categorical
